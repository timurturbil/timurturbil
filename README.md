### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Timur 

I am technology enthusiastic, want to learn things quickly and dive deep inside it. I always believe in developing logical things which makes impact on end user. I like to publish my apps that are created by using React JS and Flutter on Githup. I like to join Hecatons in order to develop myself and I think the environment of Hecatons is awesome for group-work

Skills: DART(FLUTTER) / JS(REACT) / PYTHON(DJANGO)
